            Mia Carter has solidified her place in tennis history with her fifth Grand Slam title win at the [Tournament Name]. 
            The thrilling final match against [Opponent Name] kept fans on the edge of their seats, ending in a dramatic tiebreak. 
            "This is the result of relentless hard work and the support of my amazing team," said Carter in a post-match interview.
            The back four has been the nucleus of United's consistent inconsistency over the course of the last 18 months. 
            Some form of continuity was hoped to be established for this season with Leny Yoro, Noussair Mazraoui and Matthijs de Ligt all making the switch to Manchester during the summer window.
